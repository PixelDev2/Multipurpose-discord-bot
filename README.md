- PROJECT IS NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE (PR FOR UPDATES ARE WELCOME) - I have stopped making public source codes such as this one in that size First of all, thanks for using this Source Code, it was and is a ton of work to create and maintain it!

# Installation Guide ðŸ”¥
## âœ… Hosting Requirements
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) version 16.6 or higher, I recommend the latest STABLE version
- [python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.8 or higher, to install the database `enmap` (better-sqlite3)
