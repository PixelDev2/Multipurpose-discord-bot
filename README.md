 - nodejs version 16.6 or higher, I recommend the latest STABLE version
 - python version 3.8 or higher, to install the database enmap (better-sqlite3)
 - A VPS would be advised, so you don't need to keep your PC/laptop/RasPi 24/7 online!
 - Check out my recommended Host: BERO-HOST and use code milrato for cheap OP VPS (kvm)

# ðŸŽ¶ Music Requirements
<details>
  <summary> Click to expand</summary>

  - To allow your Bot to play music, you need to connect it to a LavaLink station! There are many public ones out there for example lava.link An example for a public configuration will be listed down below.
  1 - Make sure Java 11 is installed on your system!
  2 - Download Lavalink.jar
  3 - Download application.yml
      - Download my example, it's the configuration for the lavalink.jar file!
  4 - Now put application.yml and Lavalink.jar in the same folder and start it
  - To start LavaLink type: java -jar Lavalink.jar
  - Make sure to keep your terminal Open!
  - If you want to use something like npm i -g pm2 to host it without keeping your terminal open type: pm2 start java -- -jar Lavalink.jar
  5 - The settings like password in application.yml and port must be provided in the botconfig/config.json of the Bot
    - If you used the default settings, than no adjustments are needed and it should look like this:
```json
{
   "clientsettings": {
       "nodes": [
           {
               "host": "localhost",
               "port": 2333,
               "password": "youshallnotpass"
           }
       ]
   }
}
```

**6 - You don't want to host your own LavaLink?**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Or just use something like this:

```json
{
   "clientsettings": {
       "nodes": [
           {
               "host": "lava.link",
               "port": 80,
               "password": "Anything for the Password"
           }
       ]
   }
}
```
# ðŸ¤– Configuration and Starting
<details>
  <summary> Click to expand</summary>

  NOTE: You can do the exact same configuration inside of the example.env file, just make sure to rename it to .env or use environment variables!

Check `ðŸŽ¶ Music Requirements` that you started lavalink / use a valid public lavalink station.
Fill in all required data in ./botconfig/config.json NOTE: If you're on replit.com, it is exposed to everyone!(use .env instead)
Fill in all required data in the .json files in ./social_log/ (./social_log/streamconfig.json & ./social_log/twitter.json), if you want the SOCIAL LOGS to work! (the key authToken in streamconfig does not need to be filled in!)
You can adjust some settings in the other ./botconfig/*.json Files, BUT PLEASE KEEP MY CREDITS & ADS! This is the only way on how my hard work is "revenued".
Now start the bot by opening a cmd line in that folder and typing: node index.js or npm start * If you don't want to keep the terminal open or if you're on linux, check out pm2 (and my tutorial) and type: pm2 start --name Bot_Name index.js
