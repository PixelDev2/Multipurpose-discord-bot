# Public Bot and Discord Server!
[ðŸ“¢ Join our Discord Server!](https://discord.gg/whpAuajamK)

# Important notes
- PROJECT IS NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE (PR FOR UPDATES ARE WELCOME) - I have stopped making public source codes such as this one in that size First of all, thanks for using this Source Code, it was and is a ton of work to create and maintain it!

# Installation Guide ðŸ”¥
## âœ… Hosting Requirements
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) version 16.6 or higher, I recommend the latest STABLE version
- [python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.8 or higher, to install the database `enmap` (better-sqlite3)
- Check out my recommended Host: [BERO-HOST](https://bero.host/) and use code `milrato` for cheap OP VPS (kvm)

## ðŸ¤– Bot Requirements
1. Download the [Source Code](https://github.com/PixelDev2/Multipurpose-discord-bot)
   - Either by: git clone https://github.com/PixelDev2/Multipurpose-discord-bot
   - Or by downloading it as a zip from the releases tab or a branch.

 ## ðŸŽ¶ Music Requirements
 *To allow your Bot to play music, you need to connect it to a LavaLink station! There are many public ones out there for example lava.link An example for a public configuration will be listed down below.*

1. Make sure `Java 11` is installed on your system!
   -    [Click here for a Download for Linux](https://github.com/Tomato6966/Debian-Cheat-Sheet-Setup/wiki/3.5.2-java-11)
   -    [Click here for a Download for Windows â€‹](https://downloads.milrato.eu/windows/java/jdk-11.0.11.exe)
2. Download [Lavalink.jar](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/download/3.4/Lavalink.jar)
   - Here is a direct link:
     https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/download/3.4/Lavalink.jar
   - If you are on linux do this: `wget` `https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/download/3.4/Lavalink.jar` (prep: `apt-get install -y wget`)
3. Download [application.yml](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/734517910025928765/934084553751015475/application.yml)
   - Download my example, it's the configuration for the lavalink.jar file!
4. Now put application.yml and Lavalink.jar in the same folder and start it
  - To start LavaLink type: `java -jar Lavalink.jar`
  - Make sure to keep your terminal Open!
  - If you want to use something like `npm i -g pm2` to host it without keeping your terminal open type: `pm2 start java -- -jar Lavalink.jar`
5. The settings like password in application.yml and port must be provided in the `botconfig/config.json` of the Bot
  - If you used the default settings, than no adjustments are needed and it should look like this:
```json
{
   "clientsettings": {
       "nodes": [
           {
               "host": "localhost",
               "port": 2333,
               "password": "youshallnotpass"
           }
       ]
   }
}
```

**6 - You don't want to host your own LavaLink?**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â€¢ Or just use something like this:

```json
{
   "clientsettings": {
       "nodes": [
           {
               "host": "lava.link",
               "port": 80,
               "password": "Anything for the Password"
           }
       ]
   }
}
```
