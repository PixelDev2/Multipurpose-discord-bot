 - nodejs version 16.6 or higher, I recommend the latest STABLE version
 - python version 3.8 or higher, to install the database enmap (better-sqlite3)
 - A VPS would be advised, so you don't need to keep your PC/laptop/RasPi 24/7 online!
 - Check out my recommended Host: BERO-HOST and use code milrato for cheap OP VPS (kvm)
